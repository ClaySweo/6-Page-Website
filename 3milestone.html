    <h2 class="green3">MOS Technology 6502</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Despite the prior achievements with the first CPU and GPU, there were few applications of these great tools. This was changed by the <i>MOS Technology 6502</i>, which was one of the most impactful CPU's of its time. The chip was created by a small group who called themselves Mos Technology in 1975. It was used in many computers and video game consoles, like the Atari 2600, Apple II, Nintendo Entertainment System, Commodore 64, and the Atari Lynx. 
        These machines revolutionized their respective industry, as they ushered in the golden age of gaming. One of the greatest features of the <i>MOS Technology 6502</i> was its price, as it was cheap enough to place into consoles which could be marketed to the middle class. 
       The great power contrasted the affordable price by so much that all other competitors had to lower their prices, as they could not compete. Almost all people from the team of creators of the <i>MOS  
       Technology 6502</i> originated at Motorola, which soon became another of their competitors. In spite of this, everything used the MOS processor as it was just this far ahead.  
       Most people did not have a computer at home until the revolution this CPU started; this computer revolution made computers cheap and small enough to allow every family to have one. The success of the <i>MOS Technology 6502</i> was so great that the MOS Technology group received a lawsuit from Motorola, their former employer.  
       This lawsuit ended with an agreement to share patents, allowed both companies to further technology. </p>
