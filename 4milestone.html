    <h2 class="green4">GTX 1080</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>All of these computer parts were massively influential in the 90's, yet none of them hold up in today's world. That is where the <i>GTX 1080</i> differs, which came out very recently in May 27, 2016. 
        This GPU was the pinnacle of technology on its release date, being highly priced and sought after for its performance. It was marketed as a higher end GPU, which fitted the price tag that most could not afford. The <i>GTX 1080</i> was released with the rest of the NVIDIA 10 series GPU's, and was only exceeded in performance by three of them. 
        Before the 10 series, the computer market had stagnated in higher quality parts; NVIDIA changed this greatly with some of the best graphics cards to date. The <i>GTX 1080</i> and the GTX 1070 were the first to be released under the new Pascal architecture, which outperformed the older Maxwell architecture. This new architecture made way for SLI Bridge Technology, which allowed the user to connect multiple GPU's together for increased performance on some tasks. Another new feature was the triple buffering ability, which stopped screen tearing without compromising speeds at the cost of extra VRAM usage. 
        All of these features were introduced with the Founders Edition, which is the first version released solely by NVIDIA. After the release of every GPU, partnered manufacturers create their own versions of the product, which usually improve cooling or other small performance issues. These versions are often what makes a graphics card, yet the Founders Edition of the <i>GTX 1080</i> changed the market without them.</p>
