    <h2 class="green5">GTX 3090</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Lastly, there is one of the strongest GPU's to this day, the <i>RTX 3090</i>. Just skipping the 20 series graphics cards, which were only a proof of the raytracing design, NVIDIA created the 30 series to show their great performance GPUs soon after the 30 series. This specific card was released September 24, 2020, and is currently the highest end of the cards NVIDIA makes for non-rendering purposes. 
        The main selling point of the <i>RTX 3090</i> was its tensor cores, which allowed for raytracing. The previous generation could also use tensor cores for raytracing, but the performance was lacking behind its competitors. This feature could do calculations for light casting that could only be done through long rendering processes before. What used to be isolated to small scale events that took hours to create in programs like Blender,
        could now be done in real time. The main drawback to this GPU is its price and its availability, which trace back to two main sources. Both of these were affected by the COVID pandemic and the supply chain problems, as not enough cards could be made to fulfill the demand. Some even say that NVIDIA manufactured the scarcity in their <i>RTX 3090</i> cards by making too little so they could sell at high prices. The scarcity could also be attributed to the relatively recent advent of cryptocurrency mining, as it usually requires many high performance GPUs to maintain efficiency. There are rumors that a successor to the <i>RTX 3090</i>, called the RTX 3090 Ti,
        will be announced, but it is unconfirmed.</p>
