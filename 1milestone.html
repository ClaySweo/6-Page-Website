    <p>NVIDIA started their journey in the industry of graphics cards just before the turn of the century. On October 11, 1999. Nvidia released the first version of their <i>GeForce 256</i>, which significantly outperformed graphics chips that had been made in the past. This was marketed to consumers as the first full GPU, as it contained all of the engines and components to process over 10 million polygons a second. Modern graphics cards can perform at much higher levels than this, but none can replicate the impact this GPU had on the computing industry. Video games and computers graphics are limited by the lack of processing power in their time, so when something this monumental was released, great improvement is bound to be made.</p>
    <p>The burden of tasks like video gaming on the system was so great that they could not be done efficiently without a dedicated piece of hardware. This is where the <i>GeForce 256</i> fit into its place, as it sped up these processes by 50% or more. Despite this performance boost, the <i>GeForce 256</i> underperformed compared to its competitors when using a higher end or higher performance CPU. This was one of the main criticisms for "the first ever graphics processing unit" as its high price did not justify the subpar performance on high quality CPUs. Very little support existed for the <i>GeForce 256</i> when it came out, so much of the performance was unusable in application; the GPU could not even be installed in most motherboards on release day.</p>
